# Tip-Calculator

A simple Python script that helps users quickly and accurately calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including tax and tip.

- Prompts the user for the total bill, subtotal (pre-tax amount), tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill.
- Calculates tax as the difference between the total bill and the subtotal.
- Computes the tip amount based on the subtotal and user-defined tip percentage.
- Divides the total cost (including tip) among the specified number of people.
- Displays the final amount each person should pay, rounded to two decimal places.
